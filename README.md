These tools can be used to extract TIFF files and metadata from a legacy database called Alchemy, created by Image Management Systems, Inc.

A website advertising this software can still be [found here](https://www.imagemgt.com/alchemy.html) in all its crusty Web 1.0 glory.

This is part of a research project I'm doing with my academic advisor at [IUPUI](https://luddy.iupui.edu/). The goal is to preserve 900+ CD-ROMs of scanned nonprofit tax forms. 

Each CD-ROM stores the documents as a single gigantic binary file, which is actually countless TIFF files concatenated together. This tool separates them and also extracts relevant metadata as [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

Eventually, the documents will be digitally preserved in the PDF-A format and displayed in a searchable database for use by the public and by researchers.
