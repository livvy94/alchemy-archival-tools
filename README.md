# Alchemy Archival Tools

These tools, still a work in progress, will be used to extract TIFF images and metadata from a legacy database called Alchemy, created by Image Management Systems, Inc.

A website advertising this software can be [found here](https://www.imagemgt.com/alchemy.html) in all its crusty Web 1.0 glory.

This is part of a research project I'm doing with my academic advisor at [IUPUI](https://luddy.iupui.edu/). The goal is to convert 900+ CD-ROMs that contain these databases into the PDF-A format. Metadata will also be extracted and saved alongside the PDF-As. (Format to be decided, probably either [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), [XML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML), or [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML))
