These tools, still a work in progress, will be used to extract TIFF images and metadata from a legacy database called Alchemy, created by Image Management Systems, Inc.

A website advertising this software can still be [found here](https://www.imagemgt.com/alchemy.html) in all its crusty Web 1.0 glory.

This is part of a research project I'm doing with my academic advisor at [IUPUI](https://luddy.iupui.edu/). The goal is to migrate 900+ CD-ROMs, each containing scanned documents stored as countless TIFF files in a single binary file, to the PDF-A format. Metadata will also be extracted and saved alongside the PDFs as [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).
